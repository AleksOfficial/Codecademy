<!--
  Semantic HTML: elements are based on their meaning, not how they are presented
  span/div elements are non semantic cuz no information whats inside them
  ^header element is a semantic element

  Why use it:
  -> Accessibility: inceases for old people/disabled people/mobile devices: screenreader/browser can interpret it better
  -> SEO: identify the content of site and display most important content appropriately
  -> Easy to understand: easier to read for web devs

  section: defines elements in a doc such as headings/chapters
  article: element holds content that makes sense on its own
